    <h1 class="bodytext">It's important to note that I studied Fine Arts (1988-1990) at <span class="pro">the County College of Morris (CCM) </span> and Graphic Design (1990-1992) at <span class="pro2">Montclair State University</span>, both in Northern NJ, to earn a AA Degree and BA Degree, respectively.<br>

    <H1 class="title2">WHERE DID I GO?</H1>

    <img class="picture" src="images/shoprite2.jpg" alt="ShopRite Parsippany NJ store #355">


  <h1 class="bodytext">Without Graphic Design there for me, and to keep a roof over my head and food on my table, I took a local job in Parsippany, NJ as an Personal Online Shopper at<span class="pro"> ShopRite #355. </span>  I figured it's still retail, but instead of being in a corporate office advertising products in print form, I would actually be in store collecting those same items in the Supermarket.  It was honest work and I was there for two successful years. <span class="pro">(2020-2022) </span></h1> 

  <hr>

  <h1 class="bodytext">Next, I had the opportunity to help my family<span class="pro"> (mom in nearby nursing home) </span> so I moved to Washington, NJ in Warren County as I continued this line of work. (Personal Online Shopper) This time it is with <span class="pro2">Walmart #2503 </span>in Hackettstown, NJ. <span class="pro">(2020-Present) </span> I was able to find additional success as shown below with an award I am very proud of.</h1>

  <hr>

  <h1 class="bodytext">With all this being said, my love is still with Graphic Design. In my free time, I spent that time learning Web Design part time, <span class="pro">starting in 2020,</span> off the internet with helpful courses from the Udemy and YouTube platforms.  Someday, I will return to this wonderful profession.</h1>

  <h3 class="title2">HOW CORPORATE WORK RELATES TO INSTORE WORK, AND VICE VERSA = BOTH ADVERTISING SUCCESSES</h3>

    
 <h1 class="bodytext">Working in a competitive corporate setting prepared me for a successful time as an Personal Online Shopper, no doubt about it.  I would place items in the circular from its data bases and make that page attractive.  </h1>  

 <hr>
 
 <h1 class="bodytext">Now I am at store level, and I remember those items from the circular as I find them for real on the shelves of the asiles in an actual retail store.</h1>
 
 <hr>

 <h1 class="bodytext">Now with the successful experiences of retail shopping for the customers at store level, it can translate back easily to a corporate enviroment. I will be able to create print and digital advertisements effectively because I saw and dealt with them first hand when I was with ShopRite and Walmart for the past years in busy situations.</h1>

 <h1 class="bodytext">Above, a days activity at Walmart #2503 on March 24, 2024.</h1>

<hr>

 <h1 class="bodytext">I am having great success today at Walmart as I did when I was working at ShopRite as my past corporate training has <span class="pro">"flexed my muscles each day for victory"</span> today at store level.</h1>

 <hr>

 <h1 class="bodytext">That<span class="pro2"> cereal </span>also can be found in a store circular, which I helped design in an office during past employment, to inform the customer of it's availability that week. One hand washes the other very nicely.</h1>

    <li class="stepsOne">The first step would be for the customer <span class="pro">to go online using the stores website</span> and pick out anything she or he wants to buy in the store.</li>

    <li class="stepsOne">The next step would be <span class="pro">for me</span> to shop for those requested items and collect them in a big cart.  I would transport those items to the proper place for storage within the digital department of the store.</li>
